NUMBERED SHOOTING SCRIPT
March 29, 1998
   
FADE IN:
1 ON COMPUTER SCREEN 1 so close it has no boundaries.
A blinding cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath the derma of black-neon glass.
A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were making the call. The cursor continues to throb, relentlessly patient, until --
Yeah?
MAN (V.O.)
Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing faster then we can read: "Call trans opt: received. 2-19-98 13:24:18 REC:Log>."
WOMAN (V.O.) Is everything in place?
On screen: "Trace program: running."
We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on a third line. The man's name is Cypher. The woman, Trinity.
TRINITY (WOMANV.O.) I said, is everything in place?
The entire screen with racing columns of numbers. Shimmering like green-electric rivers, they rush at a 10-digit phone number in the top corner.
CYPHER (MANV.O.) You weren't supposed to relieve
me.
TRINITY (V.O.)
I know but I felt like taking a
shift.
The area code is identified. The first three numbers suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.
CYPHER (V.O.)
You like him, don't you? You like
watching him?
We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like the wheels of a slot machine.
(CONTINUED)

1 CONTINUED:

TRINITY (V.O.) Don't be ridiculous.
CYPHER (V.O.) We're going to kill him. Do you
understand that? He's going to die just like the others.
TRINITY (V.O.) Morpheus believes he is the One.
Only two thin digits left.
CYPHER (V.O.)
Do you?
TRINITY (V.O.) I... it doesn't matter what I
believe.
CYPHER (V.O.) You don't, do you?
TRINITY (V.O.) If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
CYPHER (V.O.)
I intend to, believe me. Someone
has to.
The final NUMBER POPS into place --
TRINITY (V.O.) Did you hear that?
Hear what?
CYPHER (V.O.)
On screen: "Trace complete. Call origin: #312-555- 0690.
TRINITY (V.O.) Are you sure this line is clean?
CYPHER (V.O.) Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green NUMBERS GROWING into an ominous ROAR.
I better go.
TRINITY (V.O.)

She hangs up as nether world of light cuts open
we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the the computer screen. Suddenly, a flash- the darkness and we find ourselves in --
2 INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT 2
The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling, leaving patterns of permanent shadow.
We FOLLOW four armed POLICE OFFICERS using flashlights as they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves on either side of Room 303.
The biggest of them violently kicks in the door. The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before them.
BIG COP Police! Freeze!
The room is almost devoid of furniture. There is a fold- up table and chair with a phone, a modem, and a powerbook computer. The only light in the room is the glow of the computer.
Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is TRINITY; a woman in black leather.
BIG COP
Hands behind your head! Now! Do
it!
She slowly puts her hands behind her head.
3 EXT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT
A black sedan with tinted windows glides in police cruisers. AGENT SMITH, AGENT BROWN, JONES get out of the car.
They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at

Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the hotel.
LIEUTENANT I sent two units. They're
bringing her down now.
AGENT SMITH No, Lieutenant, your men are
already dead.
4 INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL 4
The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding a bead. They've done this a hundred times, they know they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuffs and Trinity moves --
It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly fast.
The eye blinks and Trinity's palm snaps up and the nose explodes, blood erupting. Her leg kicks with the force of a wrecking ball and he flies back, a two-hundred-fifty pound sack of limp meat and bone that slams into the cop farthest from her.
Trinity moves again, BULLETS RAKING the walls, flashlights sweeping with panic as the remaining cops try to stop a leather-clad ghost.
A GUN still in the cop's hand is snatched, twisted, and FIRED. There is a final violent exchange of GUNFIRE and when it's over, Trinity is the only one standing.

Morpheus! The line was traced! I

Yes. Goddamnit!
MORPHEUS (V.O.) TRINITY MORPHEUS (V.O.)
You have to focus. There is a phone. Wells and Lake. You can make it.
She takes a deep breath, centering herself. TRINITY

She drops the phone.

She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall, leading another unit of police. Trinity races to the opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the fire escape.

8 EXT. FIRE ESCAPE 8
In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at her. She can only go up.
9 EXT. ROOF 9
On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.
Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her movements so clean, gliding in and out of each jump, contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.
Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.
The roof falls away into a wide back alley. The next building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other roof.
COP
That's it, we got her now.
The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself into the air.
From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she hangs in flight, then hits, somersaulting up, still running hard.
COP
Jesus Christ -- that's impossible!
They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder up onto one knee.
It is a dizzying chase up and over the dark plateaued landscape of rooftops and sheer cliffs of brick. Ahead, she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point where her path drops away into a paved chasm, there is􏰀--

And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down stairs bleeding, broken --
But still alive.
She wheels on the smashed opening above, her gun instantly in her hand, trained, waiting for Agent Brown but is met by only a slight WIND that HISSES against the fanged maw of broken glass.
Trinity tries to move. Everything hurts.
TRINITY
Get up, Trinity. You're fine.

Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, it's TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates. Trinity sees the headlights of the truck arcing at the telephone booth as if taking aim.
Gritting through the pain, she races the truck, slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick wall, SMASHING it to PLEXIGLAS PULP.
After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of the garbage truck. Agent Smith inspects the wreckage. There is no body. Trinity is gone.

His jaw sets as he grinds his molars Agent Jones and Brown walk up behind

She got out.
AGENT JONES
AGENT SMITH It doesn't matter.
AGENT BROWN The informant is real.
Agent Smith almost smiles.
AGENT SMITH
Yes.
AGENT JONES
We have the name of their next target.
AGENT BROWN The name is Neo.
The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground, separated in the crash like a severed limb.
AGENT SMITH We'll need a search running.
AGENT JONES It's already begun.
We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER and CLOSER, until the smooth gray plastic spreads out like a horizon and the small holes widen until we FALL THROUGH one --
Swallowed by DARKNESS.
The DARKNESS CRACKLES with phosphorescent energy, the word "searching" blazing in around us as we EMERGE FROM a computer screen.
The screen flickers with windowing data as a search engine runs with a steady relentless rhythm.
We DRIFT BACK FROM the screen and INTO --

12 INT. NEO'S APARTMENT 12
It is a studio apartment that seems overgrown with technology.
Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into thickets that wind up and around the legs of several desks. Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay open like an autopsied corpse.
At the center of this technological rat-nest is NEO, a man who knows more about living inside a computer than outside one.
He is asleep in computer screen "Wake up, Neo."
Neo's eye pries looking around, screen.

He types "CTRL X" but the letter "T" appears. NEO
What...?
He hits another and an "H" appears. He keeps typing, pushing random functions and keys while the computer types out a message as though it had a mind of its own.
He stops and stares at the four words on the screen: "The Matrix has you."
NEO What the hell?
He hits the "ESC" button. Another message appears: "Follow the white rabbit."
He hits it again and the message repeats. He rubs his eyes but when he opens them, there is another message: "Knock, knock, Neo."
Someone KNOCKS on his door and he almost jumps out of his chair. He looks back at the computer, but the screen is now blank.
Someone KNOCKS again. Neo rises, still unnerved. NEO
Who is it? It's Choi.
CHOI (O.S)

Neo flips a series of locks and opens the door, leaving the chain on. A young Chinese MAN stands there with several of his friends.
NEO You're two hours late.
CHOI (MAN) I know. It's her fault.
NEO You got the money?
Two grand.
CHOI
He takes out an envelope and gives it to Neo through the cracked door.
Hold on.
NEO
He closes the door. On the floor near his bed is a book, Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulations. The book has been hollowed out and inside are several computer disks. He takes one, sticks the money in the book and drops it on the floor.
Opening the door, he hands the disk to Choi.
CHOI
Hallelujah! You are my Savior,
man! My own personal Jesus Christ!
NEO
If you get caught using that --
CHOI
I know, I know. This never
happened. You don't exist. NEO
Right...
Neo nods as the strange feeling of unrealness suddenly returns.
CHOI
Something wrong, man? You look a
little whiter than usual.
NEO
I don't know... My computer...

12 CONTINUED: (2) 12
He looks back at Choi, unable to explain what just happened.
NEO
You ever have the feeling that
you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
CHOI
All the time. It's called
mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
He smiles and slaps the hand of his nearest droog.
CHOI
It sounds to me like you need to
unplug, man. A little R&R. What do you think, Dujour, should we take him with us?
DUJOUR
Definitely.
NEO
I can't.
Come on. promise.
I have to work tomorrow.

A small white rabbit. The ROOM TILTS.
NEO
Yeah, yeah. Sure, I'll go.
13 INT. APARTMENT 13
An older apartment; a series of halls connects a chain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy casements.
Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there are.
Dressed predominately in black, people are everywhere, gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like jungle cats around a tree.

13 CONTINUED: 13
Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle of beer, feeling completely out of place. He is about to leave when he notices a woman staring at him.
The woman is Trinity. She walks straight up to him.
In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.
Hello, Neo.
TRINITY
NEO
How do you know that name?
TRINITY
I know a lot about you. I've been
wanting to meet you for some time.
NEO Who are you?
TRINITY My name is Trinity.
NEO
Trinity? The Trinity? The
Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. D-Base?
TRINITY That was a long time ago.
TRINITY Most guys do.
Neo is a little embarrassed.
NEO
Do you want to go somewhere and
talk?
TRINITY
No. It's safe here and I don't
have much time.
NEO TRINITY NEO
Gee-zus.
What?
I just thought... you were a guy.
(CONTINUED)

13.
13 CONTINUED: (2) 13
The MUSIC is so LOUD they must stand very close, talking directly into each other's ear.
She nods.
NEO
That was you on my computer?
NEO How did you do that?
TRINITY
Right now, all I can tell you, is
that you are in danger. I brought you here to warn you.
Of what?
NEO
TRINITY They're watching you, Neo.
Who is?
NEO
TRINITY
Please. Just listen. I know why
you're here, Neo. I know what you've been doing. I know why you hardly sleep, why you live alone and why, night after night, you sit at your computer. You're looking for him.
Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.
TRINITY
I know because I was once looking
for the same thing, but when he found me he told me I wasn't really looking for him. I was looking for an answer.
There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels the words, like a drug, seeping into him.
TRINITY
It's the question that drives us,
the question that brought you here. You know the question just as I did.
NEO What is the Matrix?
(CONTINUED)

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/22/98 13 CONTINUED: (3)
TRINITY
When I asked him, he said that no
one could ever be told the answer to that question. They have to see it to believe it.
She leans close, her lips almost touching his ear.
TRINITY
The answer is out there, Neo.
It's looking for you and it will find you, if you want it to.
14.
13
She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall of bodies.
A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the MUSIC, pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --
CUT TO:
14 INT. NEO'S APARTMENT 14
The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to consciousness. He strains to read the clock-face: 9:15􏰀A.M.
NEO Shitshitshit.
15 EXT. SKYSCRAPER 15
The downtown office of Meta CorTechs, a software development company.
16 INT. META CORTECHS OFFICE 16
The main offices are along each wall, the windows overlooking downtown. RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo without looking at him, typing at his computer continuously.
Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down the surface of the glass.
RHINEHEART
You have a problem with authority,
Mr. Anderson. You believe that you are special, that somehow the rules do not apply to you. Obviously, you are mistaken.
(CONTINUED)

15.
16 CONTINUED: 16
His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.
RHINEHEART
This company is one of the top
software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are a part of a whole. Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem.
He turns again.
RHINEHEART The time has come to make a
choice, Mr. Anderson. Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose to find yourself another job. Do I make myself clear?
NEO
Yes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly
clear.
17 INT. NEO'S CUBICLE 17
The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of elevators.
VOICE (O.S.) Thomas Anderson?
Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS GUY at his cubicle door.
NEO Yeah. That's me.
Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex Guy hands him the softpak.
FEDEX GUY Have a nice day.
He opens the bag. Inside is a cellular PHONE. It seems the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS. Unnerved, he flips it open.
Hello?
NEO

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 17 CONTINUED:
MORPHEUS (V.O.) Hello, Neo. Do you know who this
is?
Neo's knees give and he sinks into his chair.
NEO Morpheus...
MORPHEUS (V.O.) I've been looking for you, Neo. I
don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.
NEO Who's coming for me?
MORPHEUS (V.O.) Stand up and see for yourself.
16.
Right now?
Yes. Now. Neo starts to stand.
NEO
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
MORPHEUS (V.O.) Do it slowly. The elevator.
His head peeks up over the partition. At the elevator, he sees Agent Smith, Agent Brown and Agent Jones leading a group of cops. A female employee turns and points out Neo's cubicle.
Neo ducks.
Holy shit!
Yes.
NEO
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the Agents.
NEO
What the hell do they want with
me?!

17 CONTINUED: (2)
MORPHEUS (V.O.) I'm not sure, but if you don't
want to find out, you better get out of there.
17
How?!
NEO
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
I can guide you out, but you have
to do exactly what I say.
The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.
MORPHEUS (V.O.) The cubicle across from you is
empty.
NEO But what if...?
Go! Now!
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle just as the Agents turn into his row.
Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone tightly to him.
MORPHEUS (V.O.) Stay here for a moment.
The Agents enter Neo's empty cubicle. A cop is sent to search the bathroom.
Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.
MORPHEUS (V.O.) A little longer...
Brown is talking to another employee.
MORPHEUS (V.O.) When I tell you, go to the end of
the row to the first office on the left, stay as low as you can.
Sweat trickles down his forehead. MORPHEUS (V.O.)
Now.

Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.
Staying crouched, he sneaks away down the row, shooting across the opening to the first office on the left.
18 INT. EMPTY OFFICE The room is empty.
MORPHEUS (V.O.) Good. Outside there is a scaffold.
NEO
How do you know all this?
Morpheus laughs quietly.
MORPHEUS (V.O.) The answer is coming, Neo. There
is a window in front of you. Open it.
He opens the window. The WIND HOWLS into the room.
MORPHEUS (V.O.)
You can use the scaffold to get to
the roof.
NEO
No! It's too far away.
MORPHEUS (V.O.) There's a ledge. It's a short short climb. You can make it.
Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a concrete chasm.
NEO
No way, no way, this is crazy.
MORPHEUS (V.O.) There are only two ways out of
this building. One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody. You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.
CLICK. He hangs up. Neo looks at the door, then back at the scaffold.

NEO
This is insane! Why is this
happening to me? What did I do? I'm nobody. I didn't do anything.
He climbs up onto the window ledge. Hanging onto the frame, he steps onto the small ledge. The scaffold seems even farther away.
NEO I'm going to die.
The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building, knocking Neo off balance. Recoiling, he clings harder to the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.
He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.
NEO
This is insane! I can't do this!
Forget it!
He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the door.
Shit!
NEO
19 EXT. SKYSCRAPER 19
The Agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the dark sedan.
Trinity watches in the rearview mirror of her motorcycle. TRINITY
Shit.
20 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM 20
CLOSE ON a camera monitor; a wide angle view of a white room where Neo is sitting at a table alone. We MOVE INTO the monitor, entering the room as if the monitor was a window.
At the same moment, the door opens and the Agents enter. Agent Smith sits down across from Neo. A thick manila envelope slaps down on the table. The name on the file: "Anderson, Thomas􏰀A."
(CONTINUED)

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 20 CONTINUED:
AGENT SMITH
As you can see, we've had our eye
on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
20.
He opens the file. Paper rattle marks the silence as he flips several pages. Neo cannot tell if he is looking at the file or at him.
AGENT SMITH
It seems that you have been living
two lives. In one life, you are Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, you pay your taxes and you help your landlady carry out her garbage.
The pages continue to turn.
AGENT SMITH The other life is lived in
computers where you go by the hacker alias Neo, and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for.
Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.
AGENT SMITH
One of these lives has a future.
One of them does not. He closes the file.
AGENT SMITH
I'm going to be as forthcoming as
I can be, Mr. Anderson. You are here because we need your help.
He removes his sunglasses, his eyes are an unnatural ice- blue.
AGENT SMITH We know that you have been
contacted by a certain individual. A man who calls himself Morpheus. Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant. The fact is that he is wanted for acts of terrorism in more countries than any other man in the world.

20 CONTINUED: (2)
AGENT SMITH (CONT'D) He is considered by many
authorities to be the most dangerous man alive.
He leans closer.
AGENT SMITH
My colleagues believe that I am
wasting my time with you but I believe you want to do the right thing. It is obvious that you are an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson, and that you are interested in the future. That is why I believe you are ready to put your past mistakes behind you and get on with your life.
Neo tries to match his stare.
AGENT SMITH
We are willing to wipe the slate clean, to give you a fresh start
and all we are asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
Neo nods to himself.
20
He does.
NEO
Yeah. Wow. That sounds like a
real good deal. But I think I have a better one. How about I just give you the finger --
NEO
And you give me my phone call!
Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.
AGENT SMITH
You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.
NEO
You can't scare me with this
Gestapo crap. I know my rights. I want my phone call!
Agent Smith smiles.
(CONTINUED)
21.

20 CONTINUED: (3)
AGENT SMITH
And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good is a phone call if you are
unable to speak?
The question unnerves Neo and strangely he begins to feel the muscles in his jaw tighten. The standing Agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion grow into panic.
Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly seal shut, melding into each other until all traces of his mouth are gone.
Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the Agents restrain him, holding him in the chair.
AGENT SMITH You are going to help us, Mr.
Anderson, whether you want to or not.
Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt. From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a long, fiber-optic wire tap.
Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over his exposed abdomen. Horrified, he watches as the electronic device animates, becoming an organic creature that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.
Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into Neo's navel. He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --
-- before it begins to burrow, its tail thrashing as it worms its way inside.

She turns a dial and the machine bears down on Neo's midsection, the cylinder sucking hard at his stomach.
Neo screams, squinting in pain as Trinity watches the needle on a pressure gauge climb steadily.
TRINITY Come on, come on...
On a small monitor that projects an ultrasound-like image, we see Neo's insides begin to slither and churn. He gasps as something wiggles beneath his skin inside his stomach.

The foreboding word hangs in Neo's ear for a moment when Trinity squeezes a trigger. Electric current hammers into Neo and rigid convulsions take hold of him beneath the flickering car lamp until --
Something finally rockets wetly out of Neo's stomach through the extractor's coils.
NEO
Jesus Christ! It's real?!
That thing is real?!
Trinity lifts a glass cage at the end of the tubing. Inside, the small fluke-like bug flips and squirms, its tendrils flapping against the clear walls.
She unrolls the window and dumps it out.

Across the room, a DARK FIGURE stares out the tall windows veiled with decaying lace. He turns and his smile lights up the room. A dull ROAR of THUNDER shakes the old building.

MORPHEUS
He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible behind circular mirrored glasses. He strides to Neo and they shake hands.
MORPHEUS Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt
have guessed, I am Morpheus.
NEO It's an honor.
MORPHEUS
No, the honor is mine. Please.
Come. Sit.
He nods to Trinity and she exits through a door to an adjacent room. They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy-leather chairs.
MORPHEUS
I imagine, right now, you must be
feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
NEO You could say that.

MORPHEUS
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television. You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
NEO What truth?
MORPHEUS
That you are a slave, Neo. Like
everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.

He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with high-tech equipment, glowing ash-blue and electric green from the racks of monitors. Trinity, Apoc, Switch and Cypher look up as they enter.
MORPHEUS Apoc, are we on-line?
Almost.
APOC
He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex system of monitors, modules and drives.
MORPHEUS
Neo, time is always against us.
Will you take a seat there?
Neo sits in a chair in the center of the room and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode disks to him. Near the chair is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked. He whispers to Trinity:
NEO You did all this?
She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears. They are wired to an old hotel phone.
MORPHEUS
The pill you took is part of a
trace program. It's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
NEO What does that mean?

through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING on a KEYBOARD. Sweat beads his face. His eyes blink and twitch when he notices the mirror.
Wide-eyed, he stares as it begins to heal itself, a webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the mirror were becoming liquid.
NEO Did you...?
Cypher works with Apoc, checking reams of phosphorescent data. Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs. Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers disappear beneath the rippling surface.
Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored stuck to his fingertips.
MORPHEUS
Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
that you were so sure was real?
A flash of lightning flickers white hot against
NEO This can't be...

Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.
MORPHEUS

The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up his arms like hundreds of insects.
The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic, tipping his head as though he were sinking into the mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.
It's cold.
NEO
TRINITY I got fibrillation!
MORPHEUS

Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.

His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a HIGH-PITCHED ELECTRIC SCREAM erupts in the HEADPHONES. It is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to another computer --
Neo's body arches in agony and we are PULLED like we were pulled INTO the holes of the phone, sucked into his scream and swallowed by darkness.

His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.
Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure his face. Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs and cover his genitals.
He is struggling desperately now. Air bubbles into the Jell-O but does not break the surface. Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red rubber cocoon.
Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at the thinning elastic shroud, until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he sucks for air. Tearing himself free, he emerges from the cell.
It is Neo.
He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin. Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.
He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled with magenta gelatin, the surface of which has solidified like curdled milk. The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear to be grafted to his flesh.

To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with magenta gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and motionless, he sees other human beings.
Fanning out in a circle, there are more. All connected to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly-glowing petal attached to a black metal stem.
Above him, level after level, the stem rises seemingly forever. He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks out. The image assaults his mind.
Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an underwater abyss.
His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the intensity of the vision. The sound of the plant is like the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of Leviathan.

From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo. He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him. It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems of hard and soft polymers.
The machine seizes hold of Neo, paralyzing him as the cable lock at the back of his neck spins and opens.
The cable disengages itself. A long, clear plastic needle and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neo's skull with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid. The other connective hoses snap free and snake away as the machine lets Neo go.
Suddenly, the back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo into a black hole.
31 INT. WASTE LINE 31
The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls, sliding with the clot of gelatin.
Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up through grease traps clogged with oily clumps of cellulite.

Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the flow of waste.
The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the belly of the futuristic flying machine hovering inside the sewer main.
33 INT. HOVERCRAFT 33
The metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo onto the floor. Human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself looking straight at Morpheus.
He smiles.
Neo passes out.

Neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better. He begins to examine himself. There is a futuristic IV plugged into the jack in his forearm. He pulls it out, staring at the grafted outlet.
He runs his hand over the short hair now covering his head. His fingers find and explore the large outlet in the base of his skull.
Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the door.
NEO
Morpheus, what's happened to me?
What is this place?
MORPHEUS
More important than what is when?

The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.
MORPHEUS
And this, this is the Core. This
is where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.
It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment. Vines of coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks of life systems and computer monitors.
At the center of the web, there are six ecto-skeleton chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness. Near the circle of chairs is the control console and operator's station where the network is monitored.
MORPHEUS
You want to know what the Matrix
is, Neo? The answer is right here.
He touches the back of Neo's head.
MORPHEUS Help him, Trinity.
Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs. He feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at the back of his neck. The cable has the same kind of cerebrum chip we saw inside the plant.

Startled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the room with him.
MORPHEUS
It is our loading program. We can
load anything from clothes, to weapons, to training simulations. Anything we need.
Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the two leather chairs from the Hotel Lafayette set up in front of a large screen television.
MORPHEUS
Sit down.
Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.
NEO
Right now, we're inside a computer
program? Morpheus smiles.

Neo touches his head.

Neo's hands run over the cracked leather.
NEO
This -- This isn't real?
MORPHEUS
What is real? How do you define
real? If you're talking about what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then real is simply electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
He picks up a remote control and clicks on the television. On the television, we see images of the Twentieth Century city where Neo lived.
MORPHEUS
This is the world you know. The
world as it was at the end of the Twentieth Century. It exists now only as part of a neural- interactive simulation that we call the Matrix.
He changes the channel and we see a very different city as we enter the television.
MORPHEUS
You have been living inside a
dreamworld, Neo. As in Baudrillard's vision, your whole life has been spent inside the map, not the territory. This is the world as it exists today.
In the distance, we see the ruins of a future city protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of a long-dead corpse.
MORPHEUS 'The desert of the real.'
Beneath us, the water is gone.

We TURN AND DESCEND, SPIRALING DOWN TOWARD the lake bed which is scorched and split like burnt flesh, where we FIND Morpheus and Neo. Neo clings to the chair, trying to get his bearings.
MORPHEUS
We have only bits and pieces of
information. What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration. Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
NEO
A.I.? You mean artificial
intelligence?
MORPHEUS
Yes. A singular consciousness
that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age. I say almost funny.
He looks up and his sunglasses reflect the obsidian clouds roiling overhead.
MORPHEUS
We don't know who struck first.
Us or them. But we do know it was us that scorched the sky. At the time, they were dependent on solar power. It was believed they would be unable to survive without an energy source as abundant as the sun.
As we DESCEND INTO the circular window of his glasses, there is a flash of lightning.
MORPHEUS Throughout human history, we have
been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.

40 EXT. FETUS FIELDS 40
On the flash, we PULL BACK from the darkness which reveals itself to be the black eye of a fetus.
MORPHEUS
The Machines discovered a new form
of fusion. All they needed was a small electrical charge to initiate the reaction.
The fetus is suspended in a placenta-like husk, where its malleable skull is already growing around the brain-jack.
MORPHEUS
The human body generates more
bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s of body heat.
The husk hanging from a stalk is plucked by a thresher- like farm machine.
MORPHEUS
There are fields, endless fields
where human beings are no longer born; we are grown.

He holds up a coppertop battery.
NEO

His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair, trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.

Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it. Once it's out, he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the harness.
NEO
Don't touch me! Get away from me!
On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins. Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull as if his brain had been put into a centrifuge.

NEO
I can't go back, can I?
Morpheus is sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far corner.
MORPHEUS
No. But if you could, would you
really want to?
Deep down, Neo knows that answer.
MORPHEUS
I feel that I owe you an apology.
There is a rule that we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age. It is dangerous. They have trouble letting go. Their mind turns against them. I've seen it happen. I'm sorry. I broke the rule because I had to.
He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to himself as to Neo.
He pauses.
MORPHEUS
When the Matrix was first built
there was a man born inside that had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the truth; as long as the Matrix exists, the human race will never be free.

MORPHEUS When he died, the Oracle
prophesied his return and envisioned that his coming would hail the destruction of the Matrix, an end to the war and freedom for our people. That is why there are those of us that have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix, looking for him.
Neo can feel his eyes on him.
MORPHEUS
I did what I did because I believe
the search is over. He stands up.

Goddamn, I got to tell you, I'm fairly excited to see what you are capable of. I mean if Morpheus is right and all. We're not supposed to talk about any of that but if you are, well then this is an exciting time. We got a lot to do so let's get to it.

Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair. He begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro discs.
TANK
How about some combat training?
Neo reads the label on the disk.
NEO
Jujitsu? I'm going to learn
jujitsu?
Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.
No way.

48 INT. DOJO 48 They are standing in a very sparse Japanese-style dojo.
MORPHEUS This is a sparring program,
similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix. It has the same basic rules. Rules like gravity. What you must learn is that these rules are no different than the rules of a computer system. Some of them can be bent. Others can be broken. Understand?
Neo nods as Morpheus assumes a fighting stance.
MORPHEUS Then hit me, if you can.
Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.
It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack, but each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.
49 INT. MAIN DECK 49
While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive chairs.

All at once, everyone bolts for the door.
51 INT. DOJO 51
Neo's face is knotted, teeth clenched, as he hurls himself at Morpheus.
MORPHEUS
Good. Adaptation. Improvisation.
But your weakness isn't your technique.
Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen. His feet and fists are everywhere, taking Neo apart. For every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --
Neo falls.
Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits from his mouth, speckling the white floor of the dojo.
MORPHEUS How did I beat you?
NEO
You -- You're too fast.
MORPHEUS
Do you think my being faster,
stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.
MORPHEUS
Do you believe that's air you are
breathing now? Neo stands, nodding slowly.
MORPHEUS Their fists fly with pneumatic speed.
Again.

52 INT. MAIN DECK 52
Everyone is gathered behind Tank, watching the fight, like watching a game of Mortal Kombat.
MOUSE
Jeezus Keeerist! He's fast! Look
at his neural-kinetics! They're way above normal!
53 INT. DOJO 53
Morpheus begins to press Neo, countering blows while slipping in several stinging slaps.
MORPHEUS Come on, Neo. What are you
waiting for? You're faster than this. Don't think you are. Know you are.
Whack, Morpheus cracks Neo again. Neo's face twists with rage as the speed of the blows rises like a drum solo.
MORPHEUS
Come on! Stop trying to hit me
and just hit me.
Wham. A single blow catches Morpheus on the side of the head, knocking off his glasses.
54 INT. MAIN DECK 54 There are several gasps.
MOUSE I don't believe it!
55 INT. DOJO 55 Morpheus rubs his face, then smiles.
NEO
I know what you're trying to do --
MORPHEUS
I'm trying to free your mind, Neo,
but all I can do is show you the door. You're the one that has to step through. Tank, load the jump program.

50.
56 INT. HOVERCRAFT 56
Apoc and Switch exchange looks as Tank grabs for the disk.
57 INT. CONSTRUCT - ROOFTOP - DAY 57
Morpheus and Neo are again in the white space of the Construct. Beneath their feet, we see the jump program rush up at them until they are standing on a rooftop in a city skyline.
MORPHEUS
Let it all go, Neo. Fear. Doubt.
Disbelief. Free your mind.
Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop. And jumps. He sails through the air, his coat billowing out behind him like a cape as he lands on the rooftop across the street.
Shit.
NEO
Neo looks down at the street twenty floor below, then at Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.
NEO
Okie dokie. Free my mind. Right.
No problem.
He takes a deep breath. And starts to run.
58 INT. MAIN DECK
They are transfixed.
MOUSE What if he makes it?
APOC
No way. Not possible.
TANK
No one's ever made their first
jump.
MOUSE
I know, but what if he does?

He won't.

59 EXT. ROOFTOP 59
Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek􏰀--
-- but comes up drastically short.
His eyes widen as he plummets. Stories fly by, the ground rushing up at him, but as he hits, the ground gives way, stretching like a trapeze net. He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on his back.
He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the windblown tears from
his face. his feet.

Morpheus smiles and nods.

MOUSE What does it mean?
SWITCH
It doesn't mean anything.
CYPHER
Everyone falls the first time,
right, Trinity? But Trinity has already left.
Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out. He tries to move and groans, cradling his ribs. While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.
Morpheus exits the building and helps him to

Neo stares at the blood.
NEO
If you are killed in the Matrix,
do you die here?
MORPHEUS
The body cannot live without the
mind.
61 INT. NEO'S ROOM 61 Trinity enters from the hall, carrying a tray of food.
TRINITY
Neo, I saved you some dinner --
She sees him passed out on the bed. She sets the tray down and pulls the blanket over him.
She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly, breathing in the scent of him before slowly pulling away.
62 INT. HALL 62
Trinity steps out of Neo's room to find Cypher watching her.
CYPHER
I don't remember you ever bringing
me dinner. Trinity says nothing.
CYPHER
There's something about him, isn't
there?
TRINITY
Don't tell me you're a believer
now?

53.
62 CONTINUED: 62
CYPHER
I just keep wondering if Morpheus
is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle? She would know.
TRINITY
Morpheus will take him when he's
ready.
She turns and he watches her walk away.
63 EXT. CITY STREET - TRAINING PROGRAM - DAY 63
Morpheus moves effortlessly through a crowded downtown street while Neo struggles to keep up, constantly bumped and shouldered off the path.
MORPHEUS
The Matrix is a system, Neo, and
that system is our enemy. But when you are inside and you look around, what do you see; businessmen, lawyers, teachers, carpenters. The minds of the very people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of the system and that makes them our enemy.
A cop writing a parking ticket stares at Neo his sunglasses.
MORPHEUS
You have to understand that most
of these people are not ready to be unplugged and many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system that they will fight to protect it.

A beautiful woman in a red dress smiles at Neo as she passes by.
MORPHEUS
Were you listening to me, Neo? Or
were you looking at the woman in the red dress?
I was...

Look again.
MORPHEUS
Neo turns just as Agent Smith levels a gun at his face. Neo screams.
MORPHEUS
Freeze it.
Everything except Morpheus and Neo freezes.
NEO
This -- this isn't the Matrix?
MORPHEUS
No, it's another training program
designed to teach you one thing; if you are not one of us, you're one of them.
NEO What are they?
MORPHEUS
Sentient programs. They can move
in and out of any software still hardwired to their system. That means that anyone that we haven't unplugged is potentially an Agent. Inside the Matrix, they are everyone and they are no one.
Neo stares at the Agent.
MORPHEUS
We've survived by hiding from
them, running from them, but they are the gatekeepers, they're guarding all the doors, holding all the keys, which means that sooner or later someone is going to have to fight them.
Someone?
NEO
MORPHEUS
I won't lie to you, Neo. Every
single man or woman who has stood their ground, who has fought an Agent, has died. But where they failed, you will succeed.

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 63 CONTINUED: (2)
Why?

63
NEO
MORPHEUS
I've seen an Agent punch through a
concrete wall. Men have emptied entire clips at them and hit nothing but air. Yet their strength and their speed are still based on a world that is built by rules. Because of that they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
Neo scratches his head.
NEO
What? Are you trying to tell me
that I can dodge bullets?
MORPHEUS
No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you
that when you're ready, you won't have to.
Morpheus' cell PHONE RINGS and he flips it open.
TANK (V.O.) We got trouble.
64 EXT. SEWER MAIN
The Nebuchadnezzar blisters by, trailing a swirling,
supercharged, electromagnetic wake.
65 INT. COCKPIT
Morpheus slides into the copilot's chair next to Dozer.
MORPHEUS Did Zion send the warning?
DOZER
No. Another ship. Big Brother I
think, they're running a parallel pipeline.
Morpheus scans the decayed landscape of the sewer main that rolls by as Neo and Trinity squeeze into the cockpit behind him. An ALARM BEGINS TO SOUND.

Squiddy?
NEO
TRINITY
A Sentinel. It's a killing
machine designed for one thing.
DOZER Search and destroy.
Neo feels the ship rock to the side as it squeezes into a tiny supply line.
66 EXT. HOVERCRAFT 66 The Nebuchadnezzar sets down, almost wedged into a pipe
that barely accommodates its size.
67 INT. COCKPIT 67 Morpheus clicks the intercom.
MORPHEUS How we doing, Tank?
68 INT. MAIN DECK 68
 Tank works furiously at the operator's station as the ceaseless WHIR of the ship's TURBINES GRIND TO a HALT. The main deck is plunged into dark silence. The rest of the screw stands behind him as he whispers.
TANK
Power off-line. E.M.P. armed and
ready.
Tank's fingers curl around a small key that glows a dim red.
69 INT. COCKPIT
Neo leans into Trinity's ear.

69 CONTINUED: 69
E.M.P.?
NEO
TRINITY
An electromagnetic pulse. It
disables any electrical system in the blast radius. It's the only weapon we have against the machines.
Dozer looks up.
DOZER Now we wait.
THROUGH the cockpit's windshield, the vast cavern of the sewer main yawns before them. Strands of green haze curl round mossy icicles that dangle into a pool of churning frozen waste. Neo begins to angle around Dozer but Morpheus grabs him.
MORPHEUS Don't move. It'll hear you.
Neo freezes and they wait. Without the Nebuchadnezzar's
heating systems, the temperature in the cockpit begins to rapidly drop. The crew members huddle together, their breath freezing into a uniform cloud as it gets colder and colder.
Dozer quietly reaches to brush away the frost on the windshield and as his hand clears a swath --
They see it.
In the darkness, a shifting shadow of mechanized death. It is beautiful and terrifying. Black alloy skin flickers like sequins beneath sinewy coils and skeletal appendages.
Neo can feel the hairs on the back of his neck rise as it silently glides over them with shark-like malevolence until it disappears into the darkness.
In the frozen little room, everyone breathes a little easier.
70 INT. HALL 70 The ship is quiet and dark. Everyone is asleep.

71 INT. MAIN DECK 71
The core glows with monitor light. Cypher is in the operator's chair as Neo comes up behind him.
CYPHER
Whoa! Shit, Neo, you scared the
bejeezus out of me. NEO
Sorry.
CYPHER No, it's all right.
Neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens that seem alive with a constant flow of data.
NEO Is that...?
CYPHER The Matrix? Yeah.
Neo stares at the endlessly shifting river of information, bizarre codes and equations flowing across the face of the monitor.
NEO
Do you always look at it encoded?
CYPHER
Have to. The image translators
sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the Matrix. You get used to it, though. Your brain does the translating. I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, and redhead. You want a drink?
Neo nods and he pours a clear alcohol from a plastic jug.
CYPHER
You know, I know what you're
thinking 'cause right now I'm thinking the same thing. Actually, to tell you the truth, I've been thinking the same thing ever since I got here.
He raises the glass.
(CONTINUED)

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 71 CONTINUED:
CYPHER
Why, oh why, didn't I take that
blue pill?
He throws the shot down his throat. Neo does the same and it almost kills him. Smiling, Cypher slaps him on the back.
CYPHER
Good shit, eh? Dozer makes it.
It's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells.
59.
Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing. Cypher pours him another.
CYPHER
Can I ask you something? Did he
happen to tell you why he did it? Neo looks up, unsure.
CYPHER Why you're here?
... Yeah.
NEO
CYPHER
Gee-zus! What a mindjob. You're
here to save the world. You gotta be shitting me. What do you say to something like that?
Neo looks down at his drink.
CYPHER
I'm going to let you in on a
little secret here. Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus

NEO What happened to them?
CYPHER Dead. All dead.
How?
NEO
CYPHER
Honestly. Morpheus. He got them
all amped up believing in bullshit. I watched each of them take on an Agent and I watched each of them die. Little piece of advice: you see an Agent, you do what we do; run. Run your ass off.
Neo gulps down another shot.
NEO Thanks... for the drink.
CYPHER
Anytime.
Cypher nods as Neo heads for the ladder.
CYPHER Sweet dreams.
A71 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT A71
CHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the restaurant around us as we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous steak. The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.
We hear a voice that we recognize immediately.
AGENT SMITH
Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the face of Cypher.
(CONTINUED)

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 A71 CONTINUED:
CYPHER
You know, I know that this steak
doesn't exist. I know when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, do you know what I've realized?
He shoves it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef melting in his mouth.
CYPHER Ignorance is bliss.
61.
Agent Smith watches him chew the steak loudly, smacking it between his teeth.
CYPHER Mmm so, so goddamn good.
AGENT SMITH Then we have a deal?
CYPHER
I don't want to remember nothing.
Nothing! You understand? And I want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor. You can do that, right?
AGENT SMITH Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
Cypher takes a deep drink of wine.
CYPHER
All right. You get my body back
in a power plant, reinsert me into the Matrix and I'll get you what you want.
AGENT SMITH Access codes to the Zion

Here you go, buddy. Breakfast of
champions.

Tank slides it in front of Neo and takes a seat with the other crew members enjoying breakfast.
APOC
You mean the breakfast, lunch, and
dinner of champions.
MOUSE
If you close your eyes, it almost
feels like you're eating runny eggs.
APOC Or a bowl of snot.
MOUSE
But you know what it really
reminds me of? Cream of Wheat. Did you ever eat Cream of Wheat?
SWITCH
No, but technically neither did
you.
MOUSE
Exactly my point, because you have
to wonder, how do the machines know what Cream of Wheat really tasted like? Maybe they got it wrong, maybe what I think Cream of Wheat tasted like actually tasted like oatmeal, or tuna fish. It makes you wonder about a lot of things. Take chicken for example. Maybe they couldn't figure out what to make chicken taste like which is why chicken tastes like everything. And maybe --
APOC Shut up, Mouse.
Neo scoops up a spoonful.

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 72 CONTINUED:

It's a single-celled protein
combined with synthetic aminos, vitamins, and minerals. Everything your body needs. We grow it in a vat.

Oh no, it doesn't have everything
the body needs. He sidles up to Neo.

So I understand you've run
through the Agent training program? You know, I wrote that program.
APOC Here it comes.
MOUSE
So what did you think of her?
63.
Of who?
NEO
MOUSE
The woman in the red dress. I
designed her. She doesn't talk much but if you'd like to, you know, meet her, I could arrange a more personalized milieu.
SWITCH
The digital pimp hard at work.
MOUSE
Pay no attention to these
hypocrites, Neo. To deny our impulses is to deny the very thing that makes us human.
Morpheus enters.
MORPHEUS
I want everyone on twelve-hour
standby. We're going in. I'm taking Neo to see her.
With that he turns and leaves.

Morpheus answers the phone. MORPHEUS
We're in.
73 EXT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE - DAY 73
The door opens and for the first time since his release, Neo steps back into the Matrix. He squints at the sun which seems unnaturally bright. He is the only one without sunglasses.
Apoc and Switch remain at the door as the others enter the alley.
MORPHEUS
We should be back in an hour.
Cypher opens the driver's door of an old car as Trinity, Morpheus and Neo cross to the car, Cypher glances about quickly, then drops something inside a garbage can.

TRINITY
That the Matrix cannot tell you
who you are.
NEO But an Oracle can.
TRINITY That's different.
NEO
Obviously.
He turns to the window for a moment and then turns back.

He smiles as she turns to the window.

Tenement-like and vast, it is the kind of place where people can disappear.
76 INT. BUILDING 76
Morpheus nods to a blind man who nods back. An elevator opens and Neo follows Morpheus inside.
77 INT. ELEVATOR 77
The idea of learning one's fate begins to weigh upon Neo with a steadily growing unease.
NEO
So is this the same oracle that
made the, uh, prophecy?
MORPHEUS
Yes. She's very old. She's been
with us since the beginning.
NEO The beginning?
MORPHEUS Of the Resistance.
NEO
And she knows what? Everything?
MORPHEUS
She would say she knows enough.

NEO She helped you?
Yes.
MORPHEUS
NEO What did she tell you?
MORPHEUS That I would find the One.
DING. The ELEVATOR opens.
78 INT. HALL 78
The long dark hall beckons. Neo follows Morpheus out of the elevator and the DOORS RATTLE shut behind him. With every step, a disturbing sense of inevitability closes in around him.
At the end of the hall, Morpheus steps to the side of a door.
MORPHEUS
I told you that I can only show
you the door. You have to step through it.
Neo blows out a breath. His hand reaches but stops, hovering over the spherical handle. He backs away.
NEO
Morpheus, I don't think this is a
good idea.
Why?
MORPHEUS
NEO
I don't believe in this matter what she says
I told you
stuff. No
I'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
(CONTINUED)

MORPHEUS What do you believe in?
NEO
What do I believe in? Are you
kidding me? What do you think? The world I grew up in isn't real. My entire life was a lie. I don't believe in anything anymore.
MORPHEUS That's why we're here.
NEO
Why? So I can hear some old lady
tell me, what? That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? That I'm supposed to save the world? It sounds insane. Unbelievable. And I don't care who says it, it's still going to sound insane and unbelievable.
MORPHEUS Faith is not a matter of
reasonability. I do not believe things with my mind. I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
NEO
And you believe I'm the One?
Yes I do.
MORPHEUS
NEO
Yeah? What about the other five guys? The five before me? What
about them?
Morpheus tries to hide his heart being wrenched from his chest.
NEO
Did you believe in them too?
MORPHEUS
I believed what the Oracle told
me... no, I misunderstood what she told me. I believed that it was all about me.
This is difficult for Morpheus to admit.

68.

78 CONTINUED: (2) 78
MORPHEUS
I believed that all I had to do
was point my finger and anoint whoever I chose. I was wrong, Neo. Terribly wrong. Not a day or night passes that I do not think of them. After the fifth, I lost my way. I doubted everything the Oracle had said. I doubted myself.
He looks up at Neo.
MORPHEUS
And then I saw you, Neo, and my
world changed. You can call it an epiphany, you can call it whatever the hell you want.
It doesn't matter. It's not about a word. It's about this. So I can't explain it to you. All I can do is believe, Neo, believe that one day you will feel what I felt and know what I know; you are the sixth and the last. You are the One.
His eyes blaze.
MORPHEUS
Until that time all I am asking
from you is for you to hold on to whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
Neo feels a rush from Morpheus's intensity, the unadulterated confidence of a zealot.
All right.
NEO
He reaches for the handle which turns without him even touching it. A WOMAN wearing white opens the door.

She leads Neo down another hall and into what appears to be a family room.
There is another woman in white sitting on a couch watching a soap opera. Scattered about the room are a half dozen children. Some of them are playing, others are deep in meditation. All of them exude a kind of Zen calm.
PRIESTESS
These are the other Potentials.
You can wait here.
Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet blocks. Closer to him, a SKINNY BOY with a shaved head holds a spoon which sways like a blade of grass.
In front of him is a pile of spoons bent and twisted into knots. Neo crosses to him and sits. The boy smiles and hands Neo the spoon which is now perfectly straight.
SPOON BOY (SKINNY BOY) Do not try to bend the spoon.
That is impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth.
NEO What truth?
SPOON BOY That there is no spoon.
Neo nods, staring at the spoon.
NEO There is no spoon.

ORACLE
You're going to have to make a
choice. In one hand, you will have Morpheus's life. In the other hand, you will have your own. One of you is going to die. Which one, will be up to you.
Neo can't breathe.
ORACLE
I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
You have a good soul and I hate giving good people bad news. But don't worry, as soon as you walk outside that door, you'll start feeling better. You'll remember that you don't believe any of this fate crap. You're in control of your own life, remember?
He tries to nod as she reaches for the tray of cookies.

Just as Neo's throat is about to collapse, Morpheus explodes through the tattered plaster and lath, diving on top of Agent Smith.
The two men crash to the wet terrazzo floor.
Before Agent Smith can find his weapon, Morpheus is on him, pinning him in an iron grip.
In the crawlspace, Trinity tries to scramble up past Cypher.
TRINITY

Morpheus squeezes Agent Smith's throat.

Soldier's blinding lights cut open the darkness as Trinity, Neo and the others crash through the ceiling. Around them they hear a chorus of short, sharp coughs of grenade launchers from gas-masked figures.
Smoke blossoms from the green metal canisters. Trinity never stops moving. Searching the floor, she finds what she needs; the cover of the catch basin.

Agent Smith, unfazed, smiles, blood oozing from the shattered bridge of his nose, and returns Morpheus's head butt with three of his own in pneumatic succession.
Morpheus staggers back, his body going slack when another kick buries him deep into crunching plaster and lathe.

Trinity stares at him, hovering on the edge that he just jumped off. Her jaw sets and she starts climbing into the chair beside him.
NEO What are you doing?
TRINITY I'm coming with you.
NEO No you're not.
TRINITY
No? Let me tell you what I
believe. I believe Morpheus means more to me than he does to you. I believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since I am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then I believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
There is nothing more to say except --
TRINITY Tank, load us up.
144 INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY 144
Agent Smith sits casually across from Morpheus who is hunched over, his body leaking and twitching.
AGENT SMITH
I'd like to share a revelation
that I've had during my time here. It came to me when I tried to classify your species. I've realized that you are not actually mammals.
The life signs continue their chaotic patterns.
AGENT SMITH Every mammal on this planet
instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment. But you humans do not.

Agent Smith hides his knotting fist. He is becoming angry. It is something that isn't supposed to happen to Agents.
AGENT SMITH Leave me with him.
Agents Brown and Jones look at each other. AGENT SMITH
Now!
They leave and Agent Smith sits beside Morpheus.
AGENT SMITH
Can you hear me, Morpheus? I'm
going to be honest with you.
He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his shoulder.
AGENT SMITH
I hate this place. This zoo.
This prison. This reality, whatever you want to call it, I can't stand it any longer. It's the smell, if there is such a thing. I feel saturated by it. I can taste your stink and every time I do, I fear that I've somehow been infected by it.
He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.
AGENT SMITH Repulsive, isn't it?

He lifts Morpheus' head, holding it tightly with both hands.
AGENT SMITH
I must get out of here, I must get
free. In this mind is the key. My key.
Morpheus sneers through his pain.
AGENT SMITH
Once Zion is destroyed, there is
no need for me to be here. Do you understand? I need the codes. I have to get inside Zion. You have to tell me how.
He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.
AGENT SMITH
You are going to tell me or you
are going to die.

150 INT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY 150
In long black coats, Trinity and Neo push through the revolving doors.
Neo is carrying a duffel bag. Trinity has a large metal suitcase. They cut across the lobby to the security station, drawing nervous glances.
Dark glasses, game faces.
Neo calmly passes through the METAL DETECTOR which begins to WAIL immediately. A SECURITY GUARD moves over toward Neo, raising his metal detection wand.

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 150 CONTINUED:
GUARD
Would you please remove any
metallic items you are carrying: keys, loose change --

Neo slowly sets down his duffel bag and throws open his coat, revealing an arsenal of guns, knives and grenades slung from a climbing harness.
GUARD Holy shit --
Neo is a blur of motion. In a split second, three guards are dead before they hit the ground.
A fourth guard dives for cover, clutching his radio.
GUARD #4 Backup! Send in the backup!
He looks up as Trinity sets off the metal detector. It is the last thing he sees.
The backup arrives. A wave of soldiers blocking the elevators. The concrete cavern of the lobby becomes a white noise ROAR of GUNFIRE.
Slate walls and pillars pock, crack, and crater under a hail storm of EXPLOSIVE-tipped BULLETS.
They are met by the quivering spit of a SUB-HAND MACHINE GUN and the RAZORED WHISTLE of throwing knives. Weapons like extensions of their bodies, are used with the same deadly precision as their feet and their fists.
Bodies slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and Trinity hardly even break their stride.
151 INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE 151
Agents Jones and Brown burst into the room. Agent Smith releases Morpheus.

Agent Jones looks at Morpheus.
AGENT JONES

154 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY 154
Neo ratchets down a clamp onto the elevator cable. Both of them lock on. He looks up the long, dark throat of the building and takes a deep breath.
NEO There is no spoon.
Neo whips out his GUN and presses it to the cable, lower than they attached themselves.
BOOM! The CABLE SNAPS.
The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up through the shaft as the elevator falls away beneath them, distending space, filling it with the sound of WHISTLING METAL as they sear to the top.
155 INT. LOBBY - DAY 155
The ELEVATOR hits the bottom.
BA-BOOM!
The massive explosion blows open the doors, fire clouds engulfing the elevator section of the lobby.

Agent Jones nods and touches his earpiece.
157 EXT. ROOF - DAY 157
The roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo and Trinity stand amongst a pile of their fallen enemies.
Across the roof, the PILOT inside the army helicopter watches the last of their ferocious onslaught.
PILOT
I repeat, we are under attack!
Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by spreading locust-like swarm of static as Agent Jones emerges.
Just as she drops the final Marine, Trinity sees what's coming. Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is behind him.
Screaming, he whirls, guns filling his hands with thought-speed.
Fingers pumping, shells ejecting, dancing up and away, we look THROUGH the sights and gun smoke AT the Agent blurred with motion --
Until the hammers click against the empty metal. NEO
Trinity! Agent Jones charges.
... Help.
NEO
His GUN BOOMS as we ENTER the liquid space of --
-- BULLET-TIME.
The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead like angry flies as Neo twists, bends, ducks just between them.
Agent Jones, still running, narrows the gap, the bullets coming faster until Neo, bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.
(CONTINUED)

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 104. 157 CONTINUED:
He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across his thigh. He has only time to look up, to see Agent Jones standing over him, raising his gun a final time.
157
Only human...
AGENT JONES
Suddenly Agent Jones stops. He hears a sharp metal click.
Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the muzzle of Trinity's .45 --
-- jammed tight to his head. TRINITY
Dodge this!
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The body flies back with a flash of mercurial light and when it hits the ground, it is the pilot.
Trinity helps Neo up.
TRINITY Neo, how did you do that?
Do what?
NEO
TRINITY
You moved like they moved. I've
never seen anyone move that fast.
NEO
It wasn't fast enough.
He checks his shoulder wound.
TRINITY Are you all right?
NEO
I'm fine. Come on, we have to
keep moving. Neo sees the helicopter.
NEO
Can you fly that thing?
TRINITY She pulls out the cellular phone.

His fingers flash over the gleaming laser disks, finding one that he feeds into Trinity's supplement drive, punching the "load" commands on her keyboard.

Trinity's eyes flutter as information surges into her brain, all the essentials of flying a helicopter absorbed at light-speed.
TRINITY

161 INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY 161
Agent Jones throws open the door and enters, walking through the puddles pooling in the carpet. Over the RUSHING WATER and the ALARMS, Agent Smith hears a sound and understands the seriousness of the attack.
He turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops INTO VIEW --
Neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine gun.
No.
AGENT SMITH
The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE THROUGH the WINDOW in a CACOPHONY of CRASHING GLASS as the Agents go for their weapons.
But Neo is too close, the .50 caliber too fast and BULLETS are everywhere, PERFORATING the room.

161 CONTINUED: 161
Agent Jones is hit first, his body jack-knifing back, blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --
Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls. And finally Agent Smith.
Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.
NEO
Get up, Morpheus! Get up!
Neo grabs the climbing rope and attaches one end to his harness.
162 INT. HALL - DAY 162
Just outside the executive office, three Marines blister with snow-static.
163 INT. EXECUTIVE OFFICE - DAY 163
Slowly, Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain. When he finally opens his eyes, they are again dark and flashing with fire.
He rises from the chair, snapping his handcuffs just as the Agents enter the adjoining room. Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open door.
Nooo!
AGENT SMITH
He FIRES SWEEPING ACROSS the sheetrocked WALL in a perfect line.
For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of chalk.
And as Morpheus starts his dive for the window, a bullet buries itself in his leg, knocking him off balance.
NEO He won't make it.
Morpheus lunges, out of control --
As Neo spins, every move a whip crack, snapping the other rope-end on to a bolted bar as --
Morpheus begins to fall, when Neo hurls himself into the wide blue empty space, flying for a moment.
(CONTINUED)

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 107. 163 CONTINUED:
The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord attached to a machine.
As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other on a seemingly magnetic course until they collide.
Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation, finding hold and clinging.
Until the LINE ends, SNAPPING taut, cracking their fragile embrace. Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over, falling down --
The ground deliriously distant as Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed wrist.
163
Gotcha!
NEO
164 EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY 164
Trinity pulls the copter up and away as Agent Smith stands in the shattered window, aiming his GUN out through the curtain of rain.
PONK. PONK. PONK. The rear hull is punched full of holes and smoke and oil pour out like black blood.
TRINITY Shit-shit-no!
Neo hears the helicopter begin to die. NEO
Uh-oh --
Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the nearest building.
Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the machine above them begin to fall.
The ENGINE GRINDS, the chopping blades start to slow while --
Trinity guides the parabolic fall over the nearest roof where --
Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope goes slack. Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach himself but --

The coils of slack snap taut, yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious speed towards the edge even as --
Trinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand, grabbing for the rope with the other --
Neo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling at the parapet, when his feet hit the rain gutter and he levers up just as --
Trinity fires, severing the cord from the helicopter, falling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a GLASS skyscraper.
Holding on to the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who stands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --
She bounces against a shatterproof WINDOW that SPIDER- CRACKS out while flames erupt behind her.

Neo leads Trinity and Morpheus bounding over a set of turnstiles towards the ringing phone inside a graffiti- covered booth.
NEO

Morpheus gets in and answers the phone.
Lost in the shadow, the old man watches as Morpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its cord. His eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.

TRINITY
Neo, I have to tell you something.
I don't know what it means or even if it matters but I feel I have to say it.
The RUMBLE GROWS, the ground beginning to shake.
TRINITY
I've never told anyone this
before. I think I've been afraid to.
Behind her, the PHONE begins to RING.

When I went to the Oracle, she
told me... she told me that I was going to fall in love... But...

172 CONTINUED: 172
The RUMBLE RISES, drowning her voice. Neo is drawn towards her, their lips close enough to kiss when a TRAIN BLASTS into the station.
For a moment, they are frozen by the strobing lights of the train until Neo whispers in her ear.
NEO
Promise me you'll tell me the
rest?
She nods as he closes the booth. The PHONE RINGS once more before she lifts the receiver when, In the darkness of the far corner, Neo sees the old man in the flashing train-light as he becomes --
Agent Smith, raising a fistful of black gun-metal. NEO
No!
The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through the PLASTIC WINDOW just as Trinity disappears.

There is no past or future in these eyes. There is only what is.

GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men BLASTING, moving at impossible speed.
For a blinking moment we enter BULLET-TIME.
Gun flash tongues curl from Neo's gun, bullets float forward like a plane moving across the sky, cartridges cartwheel into space.
An instant later they are nearly on top of each other, rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored reflection of the other --
Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.
They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting, Agent Smith machine-calm. Agent Smith smiles.

NEO So are you.
The smile falls. Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER. CLICK.
Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fists flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo retreating as --
A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him slamming back against a steel column. Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that CRUNCHES into the BEAM, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel.
Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck- snapping reverse round-house. Agent Smith's glasses fly off and he glares at Neo; his eyes ice blue.
AGENT SMITH
I'm going to enjoy watching you
die, Mr. Anderson.
Agent Smith attacks with unrelenting fury, fists pounding Neo like jackhammers.

Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air, hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel, where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail.
The Agent is about to jump down and press his attack when he hears something. From deep in the tunnel, like an animal cry; a BURST of HIGH-SPEED METAL GRINDING against METAL.
The sound of an ONCOMING TRAIN.

114. 180 CONTINUED: 180
Neo tries to get up. Agent Smith jumps down onto the tracks and drop-kicks him in the face. The world again begins to shake, RUMBLING as a TRAIN NEARS.
AGENT SMITH
Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?
Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold forcing him to look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a hole in the darkness.
AGENT SMITH That is the sound of
inevitability.
Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.
AGENT SMITH
It is the sound of your death.
There is another METAL SCREECH, much LOUDER, CLOSER, as Agent Smith tightens his hold. Neo is unable to breathe.
AGENT SMITH Good-bye, Mr. Anderson.
The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent's Smith's words. The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits through the pain.
He is not ready to die.
NEO My name is Neo.
Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.
They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES into the station. Neo backflips up off the tracks just as􏰀--
The train barrels over Agent Smith.
Neo stands, knees shaking, when the TRAIN SLAMS on its emergency brake. With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of tortured RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the station.
Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the escalator􏰀--
As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his glasses again intact.

Agent Smith, waiting, .45 cocked. Neo can't move􏰀-- can't think􏰀-- BOOM.
204 INT. MAIN DECK 204
Neo's body jerks, and everyone hears it as the LIFE MONITORS SNAP FLATLINE.
Trinity screams. Morpheus stumbles back in disbelief. (CONTINUED)

MORPHEUS
No, it can't be. It can't be.
Lasers suddenly sear through the main deck as the sentinels slice open the hull.
205 INT. HALL - DAY 205
Three holes in his chest, Neo falls to the blue shag carpeting, blood smearing down the wallpaper. Agent Smith stands over him, still aiming, taking no chances.
Check him.
AGENT SMITH
206 INT. MAIN DECK 206
Amid the destruction raining around her, Trinity takes hold of Neo's body.
Neo...
TRINITY
207 INT. HALL - DAY 207 Kneeling beside him, Agent Brown checks his vital signs.
AGENT BROWN
He's gone.
Agent Smith smiles, standing over him.
AGENT SMITH Good-bye, Mr. Anderson.
208 INT. MAIN DECK 208 In tears, Morpheus takes hold of the EMP switch.
Trinity whispers in Neo's ear.
TRINITY
Neo, please, listen to me. I
promised to tell you the rest. The Oracle, she told me that I'd fall in love and that man, the man I loved would be the one. You see? You can't be dead, Neo, you can't be because I love you. You hear me? I love you!

Her eyes close and she kisses him, believing in all her heart that he will feel her lips and know that they speak the truth.
209 INT. HOTEL HALL - DAY 209 He does. And they do.
His eyes snap open.
210 INT. MAIN DECK 210
Trinity screams as the monitors jump back to life. Tank and Morpheus look at each other.
It is a miracle.
Now get up!
211 INT. HALL - DAY
TRINITY
Holding his chest, Neo struggles
of the hall, the Agents wait for
Smith glances back. He rips off
at Neo as if he were looking at a ghost.
Neo gets to his feet, all three Agents grabbing for their guns. As one, they FIRE.
No!
NEO
Neo raises his hands and the BULLETS, like a cloud of obedient bees, slow and come to a stop. They hang frozen in space, fixed like stainless steel stars.
The Agents are unable to absorb what they are seeing.
Neo plucks one of the bullets from the air. We see him and the hall reflected in the bright casing. We MOVE CLOSER UNTIL the bullet fills our vision and the distorted reflection morphs, becoming the "real" image.
He drops the bullet and the others fall to the floor.
Neo looks out, now able to see through the curtain of the Matrix. For a moment, the walls, the floor, even the Agents become a rushing stream of code.

123. 212 INT. MAIN DECK 212
All three stare transfixed with awe as the scrolling code accelerates, faster and faster, as if the machine language was unable to keep up or perhaps describe what is happening.
They begin to blur into streaks, shimmering ribbons of light that open like windows, as􏰀--
Each screen fills with brilliant, saturated color images of Neo standing in the hall.
How...?!
TANK
MORPHEUS
He is the one. He is the one!
An EXPLOSION shakes the entire ship.
213 INT. HALL 213
Agent Smith screams, his calm machine-like expression shredding with pure rage.
He rushes Neo. His attack is ferocious but Neo blocks each blow easily. Then with one quick strike to the chest he sends Agent Smith flying backwards.
For the first time since their inception, the Agents know fear.
Agent Smith gets up, bracing himself as Neo charges him and springs into a dive. But the impact doesn't come. Neo sinks into Agent Smith, disappearing, his tie and coat rippling as if he were a deep pool of water.
Spinning around he looks to the others and feels something, like a tremor before a quake, something deep, something that is going to change everything.
Suddenly a SEARING SOUND stabs through his earpiece as his chest begins to swell, then balloon as􏰀--
Neo BURSTS up out of him. And with a final death scream, Agent Smith EXPLODES like an empty husk in a brilliant cacophony of light, his shards spinning away, absorbed by the Matrix until􏰀--
Only Neo is left.
Neo faces the remaining Agents. They look at each other, the same idea striking simultaneously􏰀--
They run.

A sentinel descends towards Morpheus. On the screen we see Neo dive for the phone as􏰀--
Now! Morpheus turns the key.

217 INT. OVERFLOW PIT 217
A blinding shock of white light floods the chamber; sentinels blink and fall instantly dead, filling the pit with their cold metal carcasses.
218 INT. HOVERCRAFT 218 In the still darkness, only the humans are alive.
Neo?
TRINITY
His eyes open. Tears pour from her smiling eyes as he reaches up to touch her.
And she kisses him; it seems like it might last forever. FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
219 CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN 219
as in the opening. The cursor beating steadily, waiting. A PHONE begins to RING.
(CONTINUED)

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 219 CONTINUED:
It is answered and the screen fills instantly with the trace program. After a long beat, we recognize Neo's voice.
NEO (V.O.)
Hi. It's me. I know you're out
there. I can feel you now.
125. 219
We CLOSE IN ON the racing columns of numbers shimmering across the screen.
NEO (V.O.)
I imagine you can also feel me.
The numbers begin to lock into place.
NEO (V.O.)
You won't have to search for me
anymore. I'm done running. Done hiding. Whether I'm done fighting, I suppose, is up to you.
We GLIDE IN TOWARDS the screen.
NEO (V.O.)
I believe deep down, we both want
this world to change. I believe that the Matrix can remain our cage or it can become our chrysalis, that's what you helped me to understand. That to be free, you cannot change your cage. You have to change yourself.
We DIVE THROUGH the numbers, surging UP THROUGH the darkness, sucked TOWARDS a tight constellation of stars.
NEO (V.O.)
When I used to look out at this
world, all I could see was its edges, its boundaries, its rules and controls, its leaders and laws. But now, I see another world. A different world where all things are possible. A world of hope. Of peace.
We realize that the constellation is actually the holes in the mouthpiece of a phone. Seen from inside.
NEO (V.O.)
I can't tell you how to get there,
but I know if you can free your mind, you'll find the way.

THE MATRIX - Rev. 3/9/98 125A.

He steps out of the phone and slides on a pair of sunglasses. He looks up and we RISE.
HIGHER and HIGHER, until the city is miles below.
After a moment, Neo blasts by us, his long, black coat billowing like a black leather cape as he flies faster than a speeding bullet.
THE END
FADE OUT.
